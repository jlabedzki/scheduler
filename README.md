# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single-page application where users can navigate through a list of days and book, edit, or cancel appointments with a list of available mentors. The app updates schedule information in real-time for concurrent users via WebSockets.

This project was made using:

- Front end:
  - React
- Back end:
- Hosting/deployment:
  - Heroku (server API)
  - CircleCI (production app)
  - Netlify (production app)
- Testing:
  - Jest
  - React testing library
  - Cypress

## Purpose

BEWARE: This project was built for learning purposes. It is not intended for use in production-grade software.

This project was created and published as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## View Live Demo

NOTE: Loading the initial schedule may take a while as the app is hosted on free Heroku account, meaning the app will sleep after 30 minutes of idleness.
